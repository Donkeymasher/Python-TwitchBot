The bot itself works of the basis of scanning the chat, if it detects something perhaps a banned word (Swear word) which is done by this segment of code here:

-- c# code found in Twitch-bot.cs line 39 --
 for (buf = input.ReadLine(); ; buf = input.ReadLine())  <- this for loop gets the output from server (twitch chat) and essentially checks that it doesn't contain any thing
                                                         <- by passing the buf string variable though a series of commands which are looking for something and can respond accordingly. 
-- c# end of code -- 

An example of this ability is seen here in the PingPong stream command: 
 
-- c# code found in StreamCommands.cs line 11-19 --
 public static void PingPong(string buf, TextWriter output)
        {
            //Send pong reply to any ping messages
            if (buf.Contains("PING"))								<- here the buf variable is checks to see if it contains "PING" 
            {
                output.Write(buf.Replace("PING", "PONG") + "\r\n");	<- if it happens to the the word "PING" is replaced with "PONG"
                output.Flush();										<- the console buffer (basically where text is stored before being used) is flushed to send the new message to chat 
            }
        }															<- if the word "PING" doesn't appear nothing happens the bot then checks against another method like this.
